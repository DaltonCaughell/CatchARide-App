## Can I build/run CatchARide?

CatchARide was created as a proof of concept for a demo day. There may be bugs and or security flaws. I would not recommend using CatchARide as is. However, CatchARide can be built by running `npm install && gulp run` which will start it listening for connections on port 8000 by default.
